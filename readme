Just a semi-finished game. However, this is my favorite project in all of my productions.

Main game elements: speed-run, tight-rhythm, malicious, fun, death

My third time producing game with Unity.

Our Team: 3 programmers, 1 Art designer

Unfortunately, 1 programmer and 1 art left. Thus, we decided to terminate the project.
What a pity.
